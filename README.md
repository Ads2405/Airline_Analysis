# Data Analysis of an Airlines using Decision Trees and different Ensemble Techniques.

A user feedback analysis of the passengers travelled on the airlines and predicting further growth of the airlines or customer retention using Decision trees , Random Forest and Ensemble Methods (XGBoost) with parameter tuning.



## Decision Trees

Decision Trees are machine learning models that make decisions based on a tree-like graph of possible outcomes. They recursively split data into subsets by selecting the most informative features, leading to a tree structure. These models are used for both classification and regression tasks, providing interpretable and effective solutions in various domains.

## Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple Decision Trees during training and outputs the mode (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. By aggregating predictions, Random Forest reduces overfitting and enhances accuracy, making it a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm for various applications.

## XGBoost

XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a popular and efficient machine learning algorithm designed for speed and performance. It builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, correcting errors of the previous ones. XGBoost is widely used for classification and regression tasks, known for its high predictive accuracy and ability to handle large datasets.
